# All variables needed to run this playbook or project

# Ansible is flexible and there are many ways you can choose to place variables for the playbooks and roles they run. My preference is to keep any desired default values in their place in the playbooks or roles, but have one file to edit where required variables can be placed and/or default values overridden. My chosen pattern is to create this file for any playbook/project and place the required and desired variables here. This gives: a central place to edit needed values, the highest level of variable precedence and no need to re-pass variables when importing other playbooks into this project since variables placed here are also global in scope. To achieve this when running the playbook/project we will pass this file as parameter like so:
# ansible-playbook master.yml -e @vars/all_vars.yml -i hosts/production


#####     Required Variables      #####
host_name: "Fill in"

#####   Role - remove-config-from-bareos-server   #####

# The hostname of the machine you are removing
remove_config_from_bareos_server_host_name: "{{ host_name }}"

# The Bareos Archive Device location (or file path) where the backups volumes are stored for this host. 
# *** Make sure you do NOT put a path here that has backup volumes for other hosts ***
#remove_config_from_bareos_server_archive_device: "/z-storage/backups/{{ remove_config_from_bareos_server_host_name }}"


#####   Role - remove-config-from-nagios-server    #####

# The hostname of the machine you are removing from Nagios monitoring. Host names should not have spaces in them.
remove_config_from_nagios_server_host_name: "{{ host_name }}"
